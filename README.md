* Avoid meeting bugs, they are your enemies
* Collision with a bug will return the player to the initial position
* Player skin will be randomly changed when you reach the water
* The speed of bugs is assigned randomly each time they are crossing the screen
* The game is over when a bug hits you
* The game displays your score - number of times you reached the water without meeting the bugs
